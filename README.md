# ***A little bit about me...*** 
<p align="justify"> My name is Zanna. I'm an engineer and I do data analysis and testing on a daily basis. I work with various specially designed programs that help to keep track of work processes and eliminate problems in a timely manner when they occur. I like to look for inaccuracies, data gaps and make requests to correct them. At work, automating reports with colleagues, I got acquainted with the programming possibilities and testing process. Once upon a time, a mechanical process was successfully transformed into an automatic one. It was interesting to find inconsistencies in the generated reports step by step and to supplement and correct them together with the IT team. In the end, I am satisfied with the work done. It was also another step to try yourself in the IT field as a tester with programming skills.
<p align="justify"> Outside of work, I enjoy reading, spending time with friends at nature, or traveling together. I like the sun and the sea the best, so I mainly choose a place where it is warmer.
